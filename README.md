# solid-hackernews-a
Work in progress (permanently?). 

After completing the [tutorial](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial) rebuilding [solidjs/solid-hackernews](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-hackernews) from the ground up seemed like a way to get a guided tour to structuring an application.

## Objectives:

* Use TypeScript (transpilation first/type checking later)
* Use [Official Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) only rather than the [unofficial one](https://github.com/cheeaun/node-hnapi) (this will result in a waterfall of requests degrading client-side performance which is why the unofficial API is used in the original).

# Notes
* Started with `$ npx degit solidjs/templates/ts solid-hackernews-a`
